/**
 * A press in flight: a redraw that would replace what a finger is on waits until the press has
 * become its click (or ended without one), then runs once.
 *
 * A screen rebuilt between pointerdown and click loses the tap: the pressed node is gone, so no
 * click lands, and Chromium drops it even when the same node is put back in place; on a touch
 * screen whose rows moved, the lift lands on whatever moved under it. Late answers (an element's
 * files, the world's total beside them, another upload's progress) redraw at any moment, so those
 * redraws wait here. (The same module runs in the OnlyWorlds dashboard, parlor and Little Lens,
 * in Lantern and in Tactical Tangle.)
